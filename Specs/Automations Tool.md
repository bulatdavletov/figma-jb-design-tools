I want to create Automation tool, where I can create automations, like Apple Shortcuts, but for Figma.

The thing is: I don't want to search for plugin every time.
I want to create my own automations.

Let's think how to do it. What i need for that.

List of actions from Figma API

List of Object types

List of actions in Automations tool

Automations should be exportable/importable as JSON files (for sharing between team members or across devices).
