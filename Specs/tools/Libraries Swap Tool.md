This tool should help us migrate from old Int UI components to new ones, that are using Figma Variables instead of Figma Styles.
Old Int Ui Kit -> New Int Ui Kit Islands
Old Icons -> New Icons

I already have mapping of icons.

I need to create mapping for components.

Problem might be, if overrides from old components will not migrate to new ones.
Would be nice to introduce key parts, where overrides should be saved: texts, icons, some properties.

Also I need order of replacements. Some plugins might include components inside other components, like Tabs include Tab inside.
That might be problematic as well.

How to manually create mapping? Can it be saved to my default json as well? Or i need mechanism to update default jsons.
