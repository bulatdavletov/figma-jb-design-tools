Original plugin: ../ds-colors-cursor

I want to find the closest color variable from Islands Int UI Kit to a given color.
But original plugin is more complex than i need.
I want to simplify it to only keep Find Color Match functionality.

Persona:
Product designer: using hex in custom components, and need to find the closest color variable from Islands Int UI Kit to a given color.
