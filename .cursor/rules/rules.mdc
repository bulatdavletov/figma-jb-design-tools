Use Figma Docs to check latest iunfo about their plugin dev abilities.

Every Tool should be in separate file

Check Specs folder in order to align. Tell me if there are conflicts between them and my requiests.
Try to align with Design Principles.md

Prefer to use existing UI items, such as components and icons from @create-figma-plugin/ui, when possible

Always try to think systematically, extract common logic and components into separate files, to other places can work more constently and efficiently. Refactor and simplify things if they are too complex or not efficient.

Don't use getNodeByld if documentAccess: dynamic-page. Use figma.getNodeByldAsync instead.
